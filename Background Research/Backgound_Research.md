# Background Research
## San Franciso Bay Bird Observatory

### Introduction
The San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation of birds and their habitats through science and outreach. Birds are excellent indicators of ecosystem health. They are highly visible and cost-effective to track, and are sensitive to environmental change.

SFBBO pays close attention to impacts on birds and their habitats and gathers crucial data specific to local bird populations. They provide opportunities for people to be directly involved in the nature and science of the San Francisco Bay Area. 

San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory was started in 1970 by a collection of bird enthusiasts, including Professor Richard Mewaldt and Michael Rigney of San Jose State University, who began studying the birds that lived on and around the commercial salt ponds of the South Bay. They got support from local residents and started a project to investigate the seasonal use of the ponds by roosting and nesting waterbirds under the auspices of the South Bay Institute for Avian Studies. 

They have been engaging citizen science volunteers to help them collect data. Their mission was to increase public’s understanding of the scientific process, appreciation for birds, and desire to work for conservation.

For more than 35 years, they have been conducting bird banding research on passerines at the Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS) in Milpitas. Bird banding provides valuable information that helps researchers to study bird dispersal, migration, behavior, social structure, life span, survival rate, reproductive success, and population growth. It also allows them to understand seasonal and long term population patterns of migratory, wintering and year-round resident birds; and track individual birds, which is important in factoring survival, migratory turnover rates, and longevity.

### Mission
San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory’s mission is to conserve birds and their habitats through science and outreach. They conduct research and share the data and analysis with resource managers, other scientists, academic institutions, conservation groups, and the public to help our communities use sound science to make informed decisions that affect birds. They also share stories and information about the issues Bay Area birds face and the efforts our communities are making to address them, and offer classroom curriculum and other best practices for educators and community outreach specialists to help them increase the public's understanding of avian science and conservation.

In addition to collecting information about birds, SFBBO is also actively involved in habitat restoration projects. These projects help in restoring  the quality habitats which helps to maintain a healthy environment.

SFBBO offers environmental education to people of all ages to teach the scientific method and inspire a love for birds and other wildlife. They conduct several workshops and field trips to encourage people to involve them in the conservation of wild life.

### Study Site
The Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS) is located adjacent to lower Coyote Creek, ~5.6 km east of Alviso, Santa Clara County (3726°N-1215505°W). The area is one of the largest and oldest riparian restoration areas in the country.

This area was formerly dominated by oak savanna woodland, with riparian forests along the edges of rivers and streams, stands of willows near the tidal marshes, and widespread grasslands near the shores (Goals 1999).

Dominant riparian trees in the Santa Clara Valley include western sycamore (Platanus racemosa) and Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), along with several species of willow (Salix lucidum, S. laevigata, S. lasilopis, and S. exigua) and oak (Quercus lobata and Q. agrifolia). 

Development in the area has eliminated or degraded almost the entire matrix of riparian, willow, and moist grassland present in the valley. As a result, mature riparian habitat is confined to relatively narrow corridors. In addition, flood- and erosion-control measures have channelized portions of Coyote Creek. The area around CCFS remains one of the more relatively undisturbed riparian forests in the valley. However, disturbances include flood control projects such as creation of the overflow channel in 1989/90 (see below) within the site, and recent construction and development of the highway 237 corridor and surrounding business parks and shopping malls.

Santa Clara Valley Water District started an ambitious flood control project during 1980s at Coyote creek Field Station. They established a restoration site at Coyote Creek to grow riparian vegetation as the flood control channel construction involved removal of riparian vegetation. Researching avian use of the restoration sites through a bird banding operation was initially conducted by the Coyote Creek Riparian Station (CCRS), a non-profit that joined with SFBBO in 1999.

### What is Bird Banding?
Bird banding is the attachment of a small aluminum or plastic tag to the leg or wing of a bird to identify each individual bird. Information gained from sightings or recaptures of banded birds helps us to understand their biology and can help in protecting them and their habitats. It also allows researchers to find some fundamental information about birds, like their life-span and movements.

#### Types of bird Banding
A basic bird band is usually made of aluminum and often for larger birds, stainless steel. Each band has a unique number on it and name of the banding organization to help identify a bird. The band can have details like the location and date of banding.

Color-banding is sometimes used in addition to the basic metal band, making it possible to identify individual birds without recapturing them. These bands are made of plastic, with unique color combinations to identify individual birds. In this way it is possible, for example, to follow the movements and behavior of individuals within a group to learn more about their biology than by using metal bands only.

### Issues Birds Face
The two main issues that birds face are Habitat Loss and Climate Change. There are several other factors that impact the bird life.
#### Habitat Loss:
The biggest threat to Bird Populations is habitat loss. There is a lot of habitat loss around the San Francisco Bay area because of increased human activity. SFBBO is working on projects which include tidal marsh restoration work near Alviso and Redwood City; Snowy Plover habitat enhancements in Hayward; and Burrowing Owl habitat improvements in Fremont and San Jose. They are working to improve the health of these eco systems for birds and other species that rely on them. They are also sharing the results of their work to other organizations who can use the information to improve the habitat around bay area.
#### Climate Change:
Climate change is another major challenge that all the species are facing. Many of the Bay area birds are also under the threat of extinction because of climate changes. SFBBO is working on minimizing these effects by restoring Burrowing owl, Tidal marsh, Snowy Plover habitats. They are also providing environmental education to citizens to help them better understand the ecosystems and the threats that birds face.
#### Other Issues:
Apart from habitat loss and climate change, birds face numerous other issues and threats. These include pollution and pesticides; fire and controlled burning regimes; invasive species; collisions; entanglement and entrapment; predation; disease; and illegal trade in wildlife. SFBBO have some programs to prevent avian diseases. They are also partnering with other agencies and organizations to tackle some of the bird threats like pollution, collisions etc.
