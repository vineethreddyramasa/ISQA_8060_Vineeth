# _Data Entry Analysis Assignment_
## _Plankton Study_

### List of Files to be Analysed
1. [pond2010.xlsx](https://github.com/vineethreddyramasa/ISQA_8086_Vineeth/blob/master/Data%20Entry%20Analysis/pond2010.xlsx)
2. [zoop - temp-main.xlsx](https://github.com/vineethreddyramasa/ISQA_8086_Vineeth/blob/master/Data%20Entry%20Analysis/zoop%20-%20temp-main.xlsx)
3. [zoop - temp.xlsx](https://github.com/vineethreddyramasa/ISQA_8086_Vineeth/blob/master/Data%20Entry%20Analysis/zoop%20-%20temp.xlsx)

### Problems with the Data
The problems identified in these datasets are as follows:
1. Inconsistent Data: The Data is stored in two different formats among three files- the column headers are not consistent.
2. Incomplete Data: The Data has some empty fields which might result in wrong data analysis results.
3. Meanings of certain columns like z, Cuni #/L, Chippo #/L are not clear.
4. The units of certain columns Depth, Temp are not mentioned.
5. The columnn names are not mentioned in the graphs.
6. The highlighted fields in the spreadsheet has no explanation.
7. The file names are not consistent. i.e. they donot follow any naming conventions.
8. Two files get the data from Station A and Station B but the third files data location is not mentioned.

### Solutions
1. The table headers have been made more consistent and clear with units mentioned.
2. All the data from three files can be combined into a new file.
3. A field to record time has been added to analyse the difference in data collection between day and night.
4. All the abbreviations have been made to full names to be more clear.
5. A new column called station name has been added to be more clear where the data is collected.
6. The graphs can get more clear with clear names for x and y axes.
7. The files can be given names based on the season they were collected or can be given different version numbers.
